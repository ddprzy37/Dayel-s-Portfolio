        <p>Hi, I'm Dayel,and I'm on an exciting journey as an aspiring web developer, currently immersed in a rigorous coding BootCamp at the University of Utah. Here, I'm honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side APIs, equipping myself with the tools and knowledge needed to excel in the dynamic world of web development. </p>
        <p> I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and Chemistry from the University of Utah, achieving a GPA of 3.6.</p>
       <p>In addition to my academic background, I have a strong interest in software engineering, particularly in web development. I'm proficient in programming languages like Python and have hands-on experience in building and managing websites. For instance, I've been running my own website, www.thepresentworkshop.com, since February 2022, where I serve as an Amazon affiliate. I leverage Meta and Google tools effectively for advertising purposes.</p>
